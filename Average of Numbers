#6. Average of Numbers
#Assume a file containing a series of integers is named numbers.txt and exists on the computerâ€™s disk.
#Write a program that calculates the average of all the numbers stored in the file.


def main():
#open a file named numbers.txt
    num_file = open('numbers.txt', 'r')
    
    #initialize an accumulator to 0 
    total = 0
    
    #initialize a variable to keep count of the numbers 
    count = 0
    
    #get values from the file and calculate average
    for line in num_file:
        #convert a line to an float
        num= float(line)

        #add 1 to the count variable
        count += 1

        #record how many numbers 
        total += num

    #calculate average     
    average = total / count

    #close file
    num_file.close()

    #print average
    print(format(average, ',.2f'))
