#Write a program with a loop that asks the user to enter a series of positive
#numbers. The user should enter a negative number to signal the end of the
#series. After all the positive numbers have been entered, the program should
#display their sum.

#explain the program to the user
print("This program will ask the user to input a series of numbers and then"
      " will calculate the sum. To signal the end of the series, please enter"
      " a negative numner. This will end the prompt and display the sum of"
      " the series of numbers entered. \n")
      
#ask the user to input a positive number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
      
#Initialize an accumulator variable
total = 0

#loop to obtain input and calculate series of numbers
while num >= 0:
        total += num
        num = int(input("Enter another number: "))

#output
