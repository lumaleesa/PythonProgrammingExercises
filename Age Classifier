# Age Classifier
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a personâ€™s age. The program
# should display a message indicating whether the person is an infant, a child,
# a teenager, or an adult. Following are the guidelines:
#       If the person is 1 year old or less, he or she is an infant.
#       If the person is older than 1 year, but younger than 13 years, he or she is a child.
#       If the person is at least 13 years old, but less than 20 years old, he or she is a teenager.
#       If the person is at least 20 years old, he or she is an adult.
