#Write a program that asks the user to enter five test scores.
#The program should display a letter grade for each score and the average
#test score. Write the following functions in the program:

#calc_average. This function should accept five test scores as arguments
#and return the average of the scores.

#determine_grade. This function should accept a test score as an argument
#and return a letter grade for the score based on the following grading
#scale:
        #Score 	Letter Grade
        # 90–100 	A
        # 80–89 	B
        # 70–79 	C
        # 60–69 	D
        # Below 60 	F
