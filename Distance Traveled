#The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:

#distance = speed x time

#For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for three hours, the distance
#traveled is 120 miles. Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a
#vehicle (in miles per hour) and the number of hours it has traveled.
#It should then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled
#for each hour of that time period.

#Here is an example of the desired output:
#What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40 [Enter]

#How many hours has it traveled? 3 [Enter]

#Hour         Distance Traveled
 #1                    40
 #2                    80
 #3                   120

speed = int(input("What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? "))
while speed <0:
    print("Error: The speed cannot be a negative number")
    speed = int(input("Enter the correct speed: "))

hours= int(input("How many hours has it traveled? "))
while hours <0:
    print("Error: You may not enter a negative number")
    hours = int(input("Enter the correct hours: "))

distance= speed * hours

print("\n Hour\tDistance Traveled")
print("--------------------------")

for num in range(1,hours +1):
    distance = num *speed
    print(f'{num}\t{distance}')
