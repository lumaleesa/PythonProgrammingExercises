##A carâ€™s miles-per-gallon (MPG) can be calculated with the following formula:
            #MPG- Milesdriven / Gallonsofgasused

#Write a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons of gas used. 
#It should calculate the car's MPG and display the result.


#ask user to enter the number of miles driven
miles_driven = float(input('Please enter the number of miles driven: '))

#ask user to enter the gallons of gas used
gallons = float(input('Please enter the gallons of gas used: '))

#calculate mpg
MPG = (miles_driven / gallons)

#print mpg to user
print('The car\'s MPG is: ' , f'{MPG: .2f}')
