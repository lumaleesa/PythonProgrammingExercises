#7. Random Number File Writer

#Write a program that writes a series of random numbers to a file.
#Each random number should be in the range of 1 through 500.
#The application should let the user specify how many random numbers the file
#will hold.

#import random function
import random

def main():
    #asks user to input how many random numbers to generate
    number = int(input('How many random numbers should the file hold? '))

    #open file
    rand_num = open ('random numbers.txt', 'w')

    #generate the random numbers 
    for count in range(number):
        num = random.randint(1,500)

        #write data to file
        rand_num.write(f'{num} \n')

    #close file
    rand_num.close()

    #print confirmation that the numbers were written to the file
    print (number, 'random numbers were written to random numbers.txt.')

#run
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
