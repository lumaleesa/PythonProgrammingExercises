#Write a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a restaurant. 
#The program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food, then calculate the amounts of a 18 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax. 
#Display each of these amounts and the total.
#ask the user to input the charge for the food 
bill_amt = float(input('Please enter the cost of the meal: $'))
#calculate 18% tip 
tip = bill_amt * .18 
#calculate 7& sales tax
tax= bill_amt * .07
#calculate total
total = bill_amt + tip +tax
#print output 
print(f'\nSubtotal:$ {bill_amt:.2f}')
print(f'Tax: ${tax:.2f}')
print(f'Gratuity: ${tip:.2f}')
print(f'Total: ${total:.2f}')
